# ðŸŒ¶ The Chili Programming Language

Chili is a general-purpose, compiled programming language, focused on productivity, expressiveness and joy of programmingâ„¢.

At this stage, Chili brings the syntax and fun of a modern, high-level programming language, a robust type system and the performance characteristics of a low-level language.

## Hello, World

```rust
fn main() = println("Hello, World!")
```

For more information about up-to-date syntax and language features, check out the [demo file](https://github.com/r0nsha/chili/blob/main/examples/demo/demo.chl).

## Installation

### Windows

1. [Install](https://www.rust-lang.org/tools/install) the rust toolchain

2. [Install](https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/downloads/#build-tools-for-visual-studio-2022) Visual Studio Build Tools

   ```
   sudo apt-get update
   sudo apt-get -y install llvm-12 clang
   ```

3. Clone the repository

4. Run the build script

   ```
   ./build.bat
   ```

5. You should see a `dist` folder with the compiled binaries. Add `dist` to your PATH environment variable.

6. Restart your shell and try out the compiler:
   ```
   chili examples/playground/build.chl
   ```

### Ubuntu

1. [Install](https://www.rust-lang.org/tools/install) the rust toolchain

2. Install LLVM and Clang binaries

   ```
   sudo apt-get update
   sudo apt-get -y install llvm-12 clang
   ```

3. Clone the repository

4. Run the build script

   ```
   sh build.sh release
   ```

5. You should see a `dist` folder with the compiled binaries. Add `dist` to your PATH environment variable.

6. Restart your shell and try out the compiler:
   ```
   chili examples/playground/build.chl
   ```

## Running the example:

1. Open your favorite terminal
2. Change directory to Chili's repository's root
3. Run: `cargo run -- ./examples/hello_world.chl --run`

## Tooling

- VSCode plugin is available [here](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=chili-lang.chili) (currently includes syntax highlighting)

## Contributing

As the language is in its very early stages, every contribution will help in shaping Chili into what it will become. The best way to contribute right now, is opening issues/bugs and suggesting features/changes. This project is open source, and always will be.
